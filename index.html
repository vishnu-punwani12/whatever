  <h1>Goku's Transformations</h1>
  <h2>Goku's Base Form</h2>
  <img src="media/Goku_Artwork.png" height="400" width="200" class="center">

  <p>Let's start with the basic form. Goku, in his base form, is still a force to be reckoned with. He spent all of
    Dragon Ball, after all, in this form (with a couple of noticeable exceptions). However, in base form, he is at his
    lowest level of power. While iconic, Base Goku often discounts this form in order to transform into something far
    more super.</p>

  <h3>What is a Super Saiyan?</h3>
  A Super Saiyan is an advanced transformation assumed by members and
  hybrids of the Saiyan race with sufficient amounts
  of S-Cells in the Dragon Ball franchise.
  Earthlings (of Saiyan heritage) in Dragon Ball Online can also assume the transformation by wishing to have their
  dormant Saiyan powers unlocked.

  <b> Super Saiyan form first premiered in April 1991, within chapter 317 of the Dragon Ball manga, entitled "Life or
  Death".
  It also made its anime debut in 1991, first appearing in Dragon Ball Z episode 95, "Transformed at Last".</b>

  Goku achieves the form out of anger over the murder of his best friend Krillin, and in a what-if scenario Bardock
  achieves the form out of anger after Chilled attacked a Plant child called Berry, while Vegeta achieves the form
  through sheer frustration at his original inability to achieve it, especially when Goku already had.
  While training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, Goku informs Gohan that becoming a Super Saiyan is powered by rage and
  told him to imagine Cell and then Frieza (after Gohan stated he had never seen Cell) killing all his friends in order
  for him to transform into a Super Saiyan. As the Saiyans train during Dragon Ball Z, they discover uncharted levels
  beyond the first Super Saiyan level.
  The power increases of subsequent Super Saiyan forms are so high that by the Buu Saga, the original transformation has
  been literally reduced to a "child's plaything" (as stated by Vegeta, as both Goten and Trunks can transform and
  harness the power adeptly at such a young age).


  <h2 class="super2">Super Saiyan 2</h2>

  <p>The first method is that the Saiyan must experience a powerful emotional upheaval, much like the Super Saiyan
    transformation, but to a greater extent. Because of the intense emotion required to initiate the transformation, any
    mastery of the Super Saiyan state and mental stability attained therein is negated, and the naturally remorseless
    nature of the Saiyan race is magnified, requiring them to master the personality adaptations to an even higher
    degree.
    <i> Gohan with a gentle and docile personality became a hotheaded, (BADASS) merciless fighter after
    transforming, opting to torture Cell rather than kill him, despite Goku's pleas. The second method of obtaining the
    transformation is simply through harsh training.
    The third method is merely through instinct from a desperate need; if the Saiyan is in a situation that needs a
    quick and desperate action, like saving somebody from almost getting killed, the Saiyan will instinctively and in a
    rapid instant, transform, quickly making them more powerful.[12] The fourth method is for the Saiyan to feel out the
    tingly feeling in their back.</i>
    The power output emitted by this form is greatly increased as well, as it doubles the strength of the regular Super
    Saiyan transformation</p>

  <h2>Super Saiyan 3</h2>

  <div class="p">is the third form of Super Saiyan and the successor to the second transformation. This form extracts
    every drop of
    potential from a Saiyan's blood. Goku was the first to achieve the form and was able to do so after several years of
    vigorous training in Other World.
    Gotenks later achieves this form through the power of Trunks and Goten's fusion and Goku's example.

    <ul> form of Super Saiyan is achievable by a Saiyan who has already obtained the Super Saiyan 2 form and then trains
    intensely. Notably, it appears that this form can only be achieved under out-of-the-norm circumstances, as Goku
    achieved the form while dead, and while Goten and Trunks could not attain the form, their fusion Gotenks was able
    to.</ul>

    <u> the fourth stage of Super Saiyan's purpose was 100% utilization of physical stamina, the purpose of the Super
    Saiyan 3 transformation is to increase the utilization of ki, and as a result, the transformation consumes far more
    energy than even Super Saiyan 2.</u> This notably leads to extended levels of fatigue, even long after powering down. If
    the user has died and is not encumbered by a living body, this strain is reduced somewhat, and additional energy
    depletion is minimized (such as in Goku's case during his first fight with Majin Buu). The difference between Super
    Saiyan 3 and Super Saiyan 2, its predecessor, is immediately noticeable as speed, strength, and endurance are all
    pushed far beyond the normal limits. The sudden awakening of Super Saiyan 3 is such a violent explosion of power
    that
    the user could potentially obliterate themselves.[7] A Super Saiyan 3 can easily beat opponents that a Super Saiyan
    2
    couldn't handle.

    Gotenks showing he is also capable of transforming into Super Saiyan 3

    The first time that Goku used this form on Earth, its power caused massive tidal waves and hurricanes, and nearly
    shook the planet apart. During subsequent transformations, Goku seemingly controlled it enough to prevent such
    dangerous side effects. In addition, this power could be sensed even as far as the distance between Earth and Sacred
    World of the Kai, something that not only shocked Shin, Kibito, and Gohan, but worried them as well.</div>

  <p>is an ultimate technique that separates the consciousness from the body, allowing it to move and fight independent
    of a martial artist's thoughts and emotions.[6] It is an extraordinarily difficult technique to master, even for the
    Hakaishin.
    However, angels like Whis appear to have mastered it. As a result, it is known as the "state of the gods" (神の領域,
    kami no ryōiki).

    This technique uniquely manifests as a transformation in Son Gokū and is his most powerful form, transcending Super
    Saiyan Blue. Despite this, Beerus and the other gods recognize the transformation's completed form, hinting that it
    might not be completely unique to Gokū.[7]</p>
