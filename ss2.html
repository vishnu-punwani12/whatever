  <p>The first method is that the Saiyan must experience a powerful emotional upheaval, much like the Super Saiyan
    transformation, but to a greater extent. Because of the intense emotion required to initiate the transformation, any
    mastery of the Super Saiyan state and mental stability attained therein is negated, and the naturally remorseless
    nature of the Saiyan race is magnified, requiring them to master the personality adaptations to an even higher
    degree.
    <i> Gohan with a gentle and docile personality became a hotheaded, (BADASS) merciless fighter after
      transforming, opting to torture Cell rather than kill him, despite Goku's pleas. The second method of obtaining
      the
      transformation is simply through harsh training.
      The third method is merely through instinct from a desperate need; if the Saiyan is in a situation that needs a
      quick and desperate action, like saving somebody from almost getting killed, the Saiyan will instinctively and in
      a
      rapid instant, transform, quickly making them more powerful.[12] The fourth method is for the Saiyan to feel out
      the
      tingly feeling in their back.</i>
    The power output emitted by this form is greatly increased as well, as it doubles the strength of the regular Super
    Saiyan transformation</p>
