  <div class="p">is the third form of Super Saiyan and the successor to the second transformation. This form extracts
    every drop of
    potential from a Saiyan's blood. Goku was the first to achieve the form and was able to do so after several years of
    vigorous training in Other World.
    Gotenks later achieves this form through the power of Trunks and Goten's fusion and Goku's example.

    <ul> form of Super Saiyan is achievable by a Saiyan who has already obtained the Super Saiyan 2 form and then trains
      intensely. Notably, it appears that this form can only be achieved under out-of-the-norm circumstances, as Goku
      achieved the form while dead, and while Goten and Trunks could not attain the form, their fusion Gotenks was able
      to.</ul>

    <u> the fourth stage of Super Saiyan's purpose was 100% utilization of physical stamina, the purpose of the Super
      Saiyan 3 transformation is to increase the utilization of ki, and as a result, the transformation consumes far
      more
      energy than even Super Saiyan 2.</u> This notably leads to extended levels of fatigue, even long after powering
    down. If
    the user has died and is not encumbered by a living body, this strain is reduced somewhat, and additional energy
    depletion is minimized (such as in Goku's case during his first fight with Majin Buu). The difference between Super
    Saiyan 3 and Super Saiyan 2, its predecessor, is immediately noticeable as speed, strength, and endurance are all
    pushed far beyond the normal limits. The sudden awakening of Super Saiyan 3 is such a violent explosion of power
    that
    the user could potentially obliterate themselves.[7] A Super Saiyan 3 can easily beat opponents that a Super Saiyan
    2
    couldn't handle.

    Gotenks showing he is also capable of transforming into Super Saiyan 3

    The first time that Goku used this form on Earth, its power caused massive tidal waves and hurricanes, and nearly
    shook the planet apart. During subsequent transformations, Goku seemingly controlled it enough to prevent such
    dangerous side effects. In addition, this power could be sensed even as far as the distance between Earth and Sacred
    World of the Kai, something that not only shocked Shin, Kibito, and Gohan, but worried them as well.</div>
